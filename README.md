**Robotic Dog with Python GUI**
*Overview*
This project is an open-source quadruped robot controlled through a custom Python-based GUI. It’s designed as an affordable and educational platform to explore robotics, electronics, and programming. 
The robot features 12 servo motors for movement, sensors for motion and distance detection, and an onboard display for real-time status updates.
The goal of this project is to provide a hands-on learning experience while offering a fully functional, customizable robot that can inspire beginners and enthusiasts in robotics.

*Features*
- 404 grams of PETG filament
- 4 × TPE balls for the bottom of the legs
- 12 servos – 4 × 20 kg, 4 × 35 kg, 4 × 25 kg
- ESP32-WROOM-32U + Cooler + 2.4 GHz Antenna
- PCA9685 – Adafruit 16-Channel 12-bit PWM/Servo Driver
- 2 × HC-SR04 – Ultrasonic Distance Sensors
- MPU-9250/6500 – Gyroscope + Accelerometer
- OLED display 128×64
- 5V voltage regulator
- 7.4V battery
- 12 bearings
Python GUI built with PyQT6 for real-time control and custom programming

*Installation & Setup*
